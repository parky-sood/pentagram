# Pentagram  

**Pentagram** is an innovative platform, like Instagram, but with a twist! Instead of sharing traditional photos, users generate and share **AI-generated images** by providing creative prompts. This project combines social media dynamics with cutting-edge AI image generation technology, offering a unique way for users to express themselves and explore their creativity.

## 🚀 Features  

- **AI-Powered Image Generation:** Users create custom images by simply entering prompts.  
- **Interactive Social Platform:** Share your generated images, explore others' creations, and engage with a creative community.  
- **Prompt-Based Creativity:** Experiment with different prompts to unleash endless creative possibilities.  


## 🛠️ Technology Stack  

- **AI Model Hosting:** Used [Modal](https://modal.com) to host an **SDXL Turbo** image-generating model.  
- **Database:** Used **Firebase** for efficient and scalable data storage and retrieval.  
- **Frontend Framework:** Built the application using **Next.js** for a seamless and responsive user experience.   

## 📖 How It Works  

1. **Sign Up / Log In:** Users create an account to join the Pentagram community.  
2. **Enter a Prompt:** Provide a description of what you'd like to see.  
3. **Generate Images:** The AI processes your prompt and generates an image.  
4. **Post and Explore:** Share your creations or explore what others have shared.
